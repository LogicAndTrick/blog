Hello! I try to keep this blog "timeless", in the sense that any post should be relevant in some way - even long after the original post is made. With that in mind, I may occasionally update or delete posts if I don't like them anymore. This blog is open source, you can check it out (along with all my other projects) from the Github link at the top of the page.  
*(I used to have a lot more content, but I removed a lot of it because it wasn't very good. Hopefully my writing can improve!)*
